The main concept is that a \r\nDB server is queried and all DBs and series are listed as a tree. Each series can \r\nbe dragged and dropped into a floating DIV element. At that moment a template is \r\nloaded (templates/*) which has influx options and plotting options. The templates\r\nhave to be edited manually (JSON) atm... \r\n\r\nThis is far from being a production system, it is however very easy to setup\r\n(TODO: manual :) ) and one can get simple plots in 5-10 minutes\r\n\r\nTODO: WTFM! (W from Write)\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\nWe assume that you have already installed influxdb on any host in your network\r\nand it is accessible (API port) from the IDA host. The installation steps are:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the project (we prefer `/opt/ida`)\r\n2. Setup your web server. If is apache, you can edit the config/ida file and\r\nplace it in the correct folder of your distro.\r\n3. Edit the main web configuration (`web/js/config/default.cfg.js`) with the correct\r\ninfluxdb host/port values.\r\n4. If you have no data and you want to generate some, you can edit the scripts/vars.sh.\r\nThese are simple shell scripts that will log CPU,memory,disk,traffic and ping \r\ninformation to the influxdb. All series/data should be in dot format ie: \r\nhostname.net.if.eth0\r\n\r\nAt this point, visiting `http://<yourHost>/ida` you should see a list of DBs and \r\nseries. If you followed step #4, then make sure that your web configuration \r\nincludes \"slmon\" in the templates. These are basic templates for plotting monitoring\r\ndata.\r\n\r\n## Project structure\r\n\r\nThe major files and config for the web are:\r\n\r\n1. config/default.cfg.js: In here you specify the influxdb host settings and the \r\ntemplates that you want to use. An update/refresh interval can also be set here\r\nbut it is optional.\r\n\r\n2. templates: All templates are located into this folder and the file name format is\r\ntemp.<name>.json.js. Each template defined in the cfg file will be load. When a series\r\nis dropped in a plotting area, the template that matches closer the full series name \r\nwill be used, examples:\r\n - series: `hostname.db.net.if.eth0`, matches template `net.if`\r\n - series: `hostname.db.net.if.lo`, matches template `net.if.lo` (overrides `net.if`)\r\n - series: `hostname.db.net.if.ra0`, matches template `hostname.db.net.if.ra0`\r\n - etc...\r\n\r\n\r\n## Hacking\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
