Influxdb DAshboard

## Intro
 
This is an abstract influxdb dashboard. The main concept is that a DB server is 
queried and all DBs and series are listed as a tree. Each series can be draged and 
dropped into a floating DIV element. At that moment a template is loaded 
(templates/*) which has influx options and plotting options. The templates have 
to be edited manually (JSON) atm... 

This is far from being a production system, it is however very easy to setup
(TODO:manual :) ) and one can get simple plots in 5-10 minutes
